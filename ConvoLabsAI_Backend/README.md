## Overview

Organizations face critical challenges when it comes to delivering personalized customer experiences and integrating cutting-edge AI solutions into their operations. The **Convolabs AI** ecosystem addresses these pain points by providing:

- **Scalable conversational AI** components.  
- **Adaptive text-to-speech** capabilities with **Kokoro-82M**.  
- **Seamless integration** into larger systems—be it customer support chatbots or autonomous drones and robotics.

By utilizing **Kokoro-82M**, your applications can efficiently produce natural and context-aware speech outputs, drastically improving user engagement and accessibility.

---

## Key Features

1. **High-Quality TTS**: Converts text into natural, human-like speech.  
2. **Phonemization**: Uses `espeak-ng` and `phonemizer` for accurate phoneme generation.  
3. **Easy Integration**: Designed to be part of a larger ecosystem (e.g., web services, robotics, drone applications).  
4. **Extensible**: Leverages `torch` and `transformers` for advanced AI model capabilities.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Git**  
- **Git LFS** (to handle large model files)  
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **espeak-ng** (for phonemization)  

> **Note**: If you’re running this on a cloud platform (e.g., Google Colab) or a Linux-based server, you may use `apt-get` to install `espeak-ng`.

---

## Installation

Below are two approaches you can follow—**direct local installation** or **scripted steps** (such as in a Colab environment).

### 1. Local Installation

1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

2. **Clone the Kokoro-82M repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M
   cd Kokoro-82M
   ```

3. **Install `espeak-ng`** (for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get -y install espeak-ng
   ```

4. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install phonemizer torch transformers scipy munch
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If you have a `requirements.txt` in a separate directory, ensure you specify the correct path.

5. **Install `kokoro`**:
   ```bash
   pip install kokoro
   ```

6. **Move or adjust any directories as needed** (only if your project structure requires it):
   ```bash
   mv /mv_Kokoro82M/ Kokoro82M/
   ```
   (Update the source and destination paths accordingly.)

7. **Run the Application**:
   - If this is a standalone Python script (e.g., `app.py`):  
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - If it’s a Django/Flask application with manage scripts:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

### 2. Scripted/Colab Example

If you’re in an environment like **Google Colab**, you can run:

```bash
# Change directory to your desired project folder
cd myproject/myapp

# Install Git LFS
!git lfs install

# Clone the Kokoro-82M repository
!git clone https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M
cd Kokoro82M

# Install espeak-ng
!apt-get -qq -y install espeak-ng > /dev/null 2>&1

# Install Python dependencies
!pip install -q phonemizer torch transformers scipy munch
!pip install -r requirements.txt
!pip install kokoro

# Move or rename directories if needed
!mv /mv_Kokoro82M/ Kokoro82M/

# Run the server (Django example)
!python manage.py runserver
```

Adjust file paths and package managers based on your specific environment.

---

## Project Structure

A general layout might look like this:
```
Kokoro-82M/
├── model/          # Model files (large .bin or .pt files tracked by Git LFS)
├── app.py          # Main Python script or entrypoint
├── requirements.txt
├── src/
│   ├── inference/  # Inference-related scripts
│   └── utils/      # Utility functions
├── ...
└── README.md
```
If you are integrating this into a larger Django or Flask application, you may have additional folders like `templates/`, `static/`, or an `app/` directory with `manage.py`.

---

## Usage

1. **Text-to-Speech Inference**  
   After installation, you can run the TTS script (e.g., `app.py` or a custom script) to generate speech from text:
   ```bash
   python app.py --text "Hello world, this is Kokoro-82M speaking!"
   ```
   You can also integrate it into a web server (e.g., Flask, Django) or a CLI tool.

2. **Integration**  
   - **REST API**: Expose a `/tts` endpoint to accept text input and respond with audio data.  
   - **Microservice**: Deploy it in a container (Docker) and communicate over HTTP or gRPC.  
   - **Library Usage**: Import the relevant modules in your Python code to call TTS functions directly.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Large File Issues**  
   - Ensure you have **Git LFS** properly installed and enabled before cloning or pulling the repository.

2. **espeak-ng Errors**  
   - Double-check `espeak-ng` installation if phonemization fails.  
   - Make sure `phonemizer` recognizes your `espeak-ng` install path.

3. **Dependency Conflicts**  
   - Use a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`) to avoid version conflicts.  
   - Verify your `requirements.txt` matches your environment versions.

4. **Server or Port Errors**  
   - Confirm the correct port is open (for web apps).  
   - If you see `port already in use`, either change the port or kill the existing process.
